# OpenCV Examples

This is a simple example of using OpenCV in Python. We show how to read/write images and perform some image operations.

```
pip3 install opencv-python matplotlib
```

If you have problems installing matplotlib with Python3.7 on Windows. It is likely to resolve the issue by using Python3.6 or earlier versions.
